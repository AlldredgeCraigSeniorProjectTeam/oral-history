# Plan for the user experience that we plan to have implemented by the end of our senior project
 By the end of our 130 hours working on this senior project, Jake and I want the
 user experience of the skill to be really really good. This is our model for
 what we want that user experience to be like.

# Design decisions that guide this plan
Our skill will try to follow a few key design decisions. These will include:
• Shorter user inputs are better than longer ones.
• A limited user experience is better than a frustrating one 
• The skill should deliver on what it promises to do, nothing more, nothing less.

With more time and resources we could broaden the functionality of our skill to allow true free form inputs as the default, but for right now all we can do is polish the parts of the skill that we can guarantee will work. Because long-form input tends to get transcribed incorrectly by Alexa, we will prompt users for shorter and more direct answers. We will incorporate more open-ended prompts into the skill as we are able to demonstrate that user's responses will be correctly interpreted. 

# Examples of interactions with the final version of our skill
## Example 1:
### > User: Alexa, ask Family History to interview me.
### >>> Alexa: Welcome to Family History. Would you like to be interviewed about your memories of family, or about yourself?
### > User: My memories.
### >>> Alexa: Ok. You can say stop at any time to stop the interview. What do you remember about your maternal grandmother's kitchen?
### > User: I remember that it had white tile, and a fruit bowl on the table, and a sink that had two garbage disposals.
### >>> Alexa: What do you remember about your maternal grandmother's house?
### > User: I remember that it had a tiled sun room with a baby grand piano, that it was a white house painted white inside, and that we watched Inspector Gadget there.
### >>> Alexa: Did your maternal grandmother attend college? If so, where did she attend?
### > User: Yes, she went to school at BYU Idaho.
### >>> Alexa: What do you know about your maternal grandparent's wedding.
### > User: I don't know much, just that they cut the cake before her mother got there and that there was drama. They moved to Oklahoma after that, when my grandfather took a job at a feed lot there.
### >>> Alexa: What did your maternal grandmother like?
### > User: Stop
### >>> Alexa: OK, your memories will be added to the memories section on FamilySearch. Goodbye!

## Example 2:
### > User: Alexa, ask Family History to interview me.
### >>> Alexa: Welcome to Family History. Would you like to be interviewed about your memories of family, or about yourself?
### > User: About myself.
### >>> Alexa: OK. You can say stop at any time to stop the interview. What do you aspire to be?
### > User: I aspire to be a good mom, wife, and to be successful in my education.
### >>> Alexa: What do you like to do?
### > User: I like to go bridge jumping in the summer, and bowling in the winter.
### >>> Alexa: What do you hope?
### > User: That my children have better opportunities for college education than I did when I graduated.
### >>> Alexa: What do you wish you could give, and to who?
### > User: I wish I could give my children better opportunities.
### >>> Alexa: How do you see yourself in 5 years?
### > User: Stop
